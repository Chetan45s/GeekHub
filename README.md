# GeekHub

## Project Introduction

GeekHub project is for students, more specifically for learners. In this project we aim to provide learners a platform where they can share and utilize resources for free. Here the learners can contribute for their and otherâ€™s development by sharing study resources like blogs on any technical topic, code or any other relevant information in the form of poster, videos, etc. In this way students will get useful resources for free. In this the learners need not to sign-up for reading or commenting on the blogs or codes or any other information provided on GeekHub. They just need to visit the site and there they can read the relevant information that is provided in different categories under specific tags. The information like blogs, codes, videos, etc. are sorted on the basis of categories and on the basis of tags.
